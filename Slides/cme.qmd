# Definition

Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date. 

## Types of Options

- Underlying type: futures options, futures spread options, equity options, fx options, interest rate options

- Payout Type: call, put, exotic

- Settlement Type: cash settled, delivery

- Exercise Time: European, American, Bermudan 

# Pricing

## Option Specs

In order to understand options pricing, we need to look at the following factors:

1. Strike price
    - The specified price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold

2. Time to expiration
    - The amount of time remaining until the option expires

## Market data

1. Price of the underlying asset

2. Volatility of the underlying asset
    - How much the price of the underlying asset is expected to fluctuate

These factors are used to calculate the theoretical value of an option using a mathematical model such as the Black-Scholes model. However, the actual price of an option may also be influenced by supply and demand in the market.
